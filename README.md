|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `discourse_plugin_custom_backups_dest_dir`          | Destination path for local backup files                                     |

| `discourse_plugin_custom_backups_s3_access_key`     | S3 access key ID                                                            |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Manual Usage

To trigger a local backup manually from the server:

```bash
cd /var/www/discourse
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec ruby script/run_local_backup.rb
```

This will:
- Create a backup file (including uploads)
- Move it to the configured destination
- Optionally upload it to S3 if enabled

---

## ‚è∞ Scheduled Backups

If `discourse_plugin_custom_backups_enable_daily_job` is enabled, Discourse will automatically run the backup script once per day via the Sidekiq scheduler.

Make sure:
- Sidekiq is running
- Plugin is installed and loaded properly
- Site settings are configured correctly

---

## üìÇ Output

Backup files will be stored in the directory configured by `discourse_plugin_custom_backups_dest_dir`.

Example:
```
/var/discourse/custom_backup/backup-2025-06-18-145320.tar.gz
```
